         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The deuill led Chriſt vnto the top of an high mountaine that he might ſhew him the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the world, which deceiueth vnſtable minds: ſo would he do you, if you would be led by ſuch a guide, but I would not haue you to marke the vaine motions of ſuch a ſpirit which leads to nothing but to vanitie and pride: for after he hath led you vp to the top, and allured you by carnall pleaſures as much as he can, if you then fall downe to worſhip Mammon and embrace the world, the ſame ſpirit will afterward leade you, nay rather caſt you downe from the top of all vnto hell. Therefore I beſeech you, &amp; hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily intreate you, that you would be the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God, and the ſeruants of the ſpirit of God, to obey it, and do nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to his will that you can refraine, that you would do all thoſe good things which you would were done by you, and that you would go thither whither you would come, for all would come to heauen, but all will not go to heauen. If you will all heare, I will teach you all, yea I wil vndertake this: heare, and marke my words, &amp; you ſhalbe conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the power of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt. For I pray vnto the Lord that I may neuer
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:135771:7"/> preach to the condemnation of any among you all, which wiſheth that euerie of you were more zelous and more godly then my ſelfe. But to whom ſhall I compare you? e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the vacabond Iewes, of whom <hi>Luke</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Act. 19. 74.</note> mentioneth in the Actes, that they tooke v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon them to abiure euill ſpirits by the name of Ieſus whom <hi>Paul</hi> preached, to whom the euil ſpirits anſwered ſaying, <hi>Ieſus</hi> we know, and <hi>Paul</hi> we know, but who are ye? &amp; thoſe which had the euill ſpirits ran vpon them and ouercame them, ſo that they fled out of that houſe naked and wounded, and thus the deuill preuailed againſt them at that time, becauſe they ſought to worke with anothers inſtrument, &amp; preuaile with anothers wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon. If they would haue ſaid in the name of <hi>Ieſus</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we preach, they might haue pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed, but they thought it ſufficient that <hi>Paul</hi> preached him though they neuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed him. And ſo we leane vpon anothers ſtaffe, and thinke to be ſaued becauſe God ſaueth others. We ſhall be dealt withall as were thoſe vacabond Iewes: wherfore he wil anſwer ſuch I know, and ſuch I know, but who are ye? Therefore it behoueth vs euerie one to pray vnto the Lord, that he would furniſh vs with weapons to encounter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the euill motions of the ſpirit of

            <p>Here <hi>Simeon</hi> prayed &amp; prayſed God, yet but a ſhort prayer, for God delighteth not in much babling, like the Phariſies or like the prieſts of <hi>Bal,</hi> but <hi>Simeon</hi> prayed with <note place="margin">Mat. 6. 1.

Sam. 6.</note> gladneſſe. <hi>Iſaac</hi> was a good man, his name ſignified laughter, wherby was ſhewed what ioy &amp; laughter there ſhould be about Chriſt Ieſus, for he was the only figure, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt him ſelfe. The Virgin ſong when ſhe knew <note place="margin">Luke 1.</note> that ſhe ſhould beare him, the Angels ſong ioyfully when he was borne, and <hi>Simeon</hi> ſong <note place="margin">Luke 2.</note> when he was brought into the Temple, but as ſoone as he ſaw Chriſt, he deſired of God that he might die &amp; depart out of this earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly priſon. So ſoone as a man knoweth God, euer henceforth he crieth with the Apoſtle, <hi>I deſire to be diſſolued,</hi> that he might be with Chriſt, for Chriſt is light, &amp; as ſoone as they <note place="margin">Phil. 1. 23.</note> ſee him they ſee alſo them ſelues, his glorie, and their ſhame &amp; filthineſſe, which maketh them wiſh for death, that they might liue
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:135771:9"/> with him, and this made the martyrs deſire death or any other torment, that their dayes of iniquitie might be ended, and that ſinne might ceaſe againſt God by them: for all ſin is blood in their eyes, and all worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures vanities.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Simeon</hi> deſired death, for the feruent loue of God made life irkſome vnto him, which naturally is the moſt pleaſant thing of all vnto ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; death pleaſant vnto him, which all men hate naturally, and would giue all the riches in the world if they had it, that they might not die, ſuch loue they beare to life. So I conclude, that no man is willing to die till his conſcience be quiet in Chriſt, for then the loue of the world falleth away, like the mantell of <hi>Elias</hi> when he was rapt into <note place="margin">2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Kings 2.</note> heauen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Simeon</hi> had ſeene many things in his dayes, but when he ſaw Chriſt, he was vnwilling to liue any longer to ſee more, but like the hart which panteth with deſiring after the <note place="margin">Pſal. 42.</note> water brookes: ſo he longed ſo long, till he had ſeene with his eyes the Sauiour of the world, and then he ſo thirſted for death, that he ſought nothing elſe. And thus they that hunger after righteouſneſſe are ſatisfied and <note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> filled.</p>
            <p>It is enough for me (ſaith <hi>Iacob)</hi> that my <note place="margin">Gen. 46.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:135771:10"/> ſonne <hi>Ioſeph</hi> liueth: ſo let vs be ſatisfied with <note place="margin">Gen. 46.</note> this, that our ſauiour Chriſt liueth, &amp; where he is thither ſhal we come. I would go ſaith one, through heate and cold, through ehalth and ſickneſſe, and through all kinde of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, that I might hunger after God and after his righteouſneſſe. They that beare the croſſe of Chriſt haue al the marks of Chriſts Diſciples. None are ſo wel fed as they which went with Chriſt into the wilderneſſe, and <note place="margin">Iohn. 6.</note> where there was no food, there they all were ſatisfied and filled with wholſome food.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Simeon</hi> knew Chriſt as ſoone as he ſawe him, and embraced him as ſoone as he knew him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and enioyed him as ſoone as he embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him.</p>
            <p>Some know the word of God as ſoone as they heare it, others heare it as though they heard it not, like deafe adders which ſtop their eares at the voyce of the charmer. So <hi>Pharao</hi> would not heare the voyce of <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor Baals prieſts would not heare the voyce <note place="margin">Exod. 5. &amp;c 1. Kings 18.</note> of <hi>Elias.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Chriſt brings peace with him, not the peace of the world, but that peace which paſſeth all vnderſtanding, <hi>my peace I leaue with you:</hi> my peace remaine with you, ſaith
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:135771:10"/> he. Our peace is laid vp in Chriſt, and all the peace we haue by him, els it is no true peace. <hi>Simeon</hi> had peace enough, that he depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Pſal. 37. 37</note> in peace: ſo marke the ende of the iuſt and you ſhall then depart in peace, like the lambe vpon the croſſe. Faine would <hi>Balaam</hi> die the death of the righteous, but <hi>Balaam</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Num. 23.</note> muſt then liue the life of the righteous, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all men looke to this. Happie are they that depart in peace, when death ſaith feare, and the ſerpent ſaith deſpaire: then ſaith the ſpirit to the fleſh, crouch, &amp; bids the ſerpent flie while death openeth the priſon doores.</p>
            <p>If the Papiſts beleeued that they depart in peace, they wold neuer ſay, that thoſe which depart go to Purgatorie: &amp; ſo by their own ſaying, the worſt part is behind.</p>
            <p>Some ſay, this Purgatorie is in the earth neare to hell, and other ſay it is in the aire neare to heauen. Some ſay, they are puniſhed there by fire, and ſome ſay by water, &amp; ſome ſay by fire and water, and ſome ſay, that if it be in the earth, it is too farre then from heauen to be ſaued. Others ſay, that if it be in the aire, it is too farre from hell to be damned. Some ſay, the good Angelles tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and other ſay, that the euill ſpirits do it.

            <p>In my laſt lecture I vnfolded two queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the firſt, whether it be lawfull for a Chriſtian man to wiſh to die. The ſecond, whether we may pray for the dead, and ſay, Lord haue mercie vpon them. But all the ſeed is not fallen into good ground. &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome thinke it but a ſmall matter to ſay ſo, or as it were a venial ſinne, if it be a ſinne. But let vs take heed how we make trifles of ſinnes, for there is no dalying with God, who is iealous as a conſuming fire, when his people make ſuch ſmall accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his words. <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> Other demaund whether it be not better to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:135771:11"/> ſay God be with them, then the deuill be with them, both which are naught and to be eſchued. And herein they aske this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, like a thiefe hauing robbed a man by the high way, and being taken with it, and dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded why he did ſuch a villany, he ſaith, is it not better to rob him then to kill him? as though he muſt needes do the one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: then what a ſhameleſſe anſwer is this, for it is manifeſt, that of two euils none is to be choſen.</p>
            <p>Some wil ſay, it is a teſtimonie of our good <note place="margin">Three buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſome do vſe to maintaine prayer for the dead.</note> will. To ſuch we muſt replie ſaying, ſo it is a teſtimonie of your ignorance: and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a litle conference they will graunt, that indeed it doth not profit the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Then we muſt replie and ſay, God hath made all things to profit vs, &amp; hath commanded that nothing be vſed vnprofitably, no not ſo much as a vaine word ſpeaking, ſaying, that for euerie idle word we muſt giue account at the day of iudgement. Then they replie againe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">Mat. 12.</note> if it do them no good it doth them no harme. But we muſt reply and ſay, it were good to beware leaſt it do thy ſelfe harme. Another ſort wil replie and ſay, I pray God I neuer do worſe. But to ſuch we muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I pray God you may do better: &amp; you ſhould firſt know whether you do not harm
<pb facs="tcp:135771:12"/> before you do it. For in deed it muſt proceed of harme being ſpoken, in doubting without faith, for if you beleeued that they were layde vp in peace whome you praye for, what need you pray for them at all? But it ſhewes an vnbeleeuing heart, and we know that whatſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne, and the Lord will ſay of them, who hath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thoſe things at your hand? you haue wrought vanities. Now therefore you will not leaue it, becauſe you vſed it: then will you ſay alſo, we will not leaue our lying nor our ſwearing, nor our curſing, becauſe we haue vſed it. It will grieue me if I heare you vſe theſe ſpeeches hereafter, hauing no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon nor proofe of Scripture to maintaine it by, or to be your warrant in it. Therefore I charge you in the name of God, that you vſe them not, but rather when you heare this, or ani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Simeon</hi> wiſhed to die, and had good cauſe ſo to wiſh, becauſe God promiſed, that he ſhould be deliuered from this miſerable life when he had ſcene his glorie, and the light of Gentils.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:135771:12"/> which in deed is rather an increaſing and aggrauating thereof. But the faithfull when they wiſh to die, they do it in great zeale and loue of God, vſing it as the beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie againſt ſinne, that therby they might ceaſſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> offending their good God, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby, that they are as it were wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Becauſe the holy Ghoſt by inſpiration had declared vnto him, that he ſhould not die til he had ſeene Ieſus Chriſt, therfore the ſame ſpirit led him to the temple, &amp; ſhewed him that which it promiſed, &amp; hauing ſeene the ſame he deſireth and wiſheth to die, and be releaſed from this earthly priſon, that he might liue with God. As idle &amp; euil wiſhes are vaine, becauſe they are not according to faith, nor grounded vpon the word of God: ſo though we aske as cunningly as <hi>Iacob,</hi> and as earneſtly as the ſonnes of <hi>Zebede,</hi> yet if we aske not in faith according to knowledge, <note place="margin">Mar. 10.</note> we can not obtaine, for we muſt aske ſo that we may receiue, that we may not returne emptie.</p>
               <p>Then we ſee that the principal cauſe that moued <hi>Simeon</hi> to wiſh for death, was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had ſeene his ſauiour, and the true Meſſias which was promiſed by the father, figured by the law, ſpoken of by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,

What deſire ſhould he haue of life, when life, and ioy, and peace, and the verie brightneſſe of the image of God appeared vnto him, for all his life is but a pilgrimage of ſorow and of griefe, yea &amp; a continuall combat with ſin, therfore what ſhould he feare death. But he might haue ſayd, long haue I wayted in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, but what is all the time that is paſt, and the life that is to come to an ende? My kingdome is not of this world, and yet I <note place="margin">Iohn 18.</note> haue a kingdome, whereof I am certified now I ſee thy ſaluation thou haſt promiſed, and now is thy promiſe fulfilled, therefore bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after <note place="margin">Mat. 5.</note> righteouſneſſe, for none ſhall haue this food but they that hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger for it.

               <p>To ſome he ſhewes him ſelf as in a glaſſe, to ſome generally, to ſome particularly, ſome he calleth early, and ſome he calleth late, and <note place="margin">Mat. 20.</note> there is no hower in the day wherein he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not ſome to go labour in his vineyard.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:135771:20"/> called ſaluation it ſelf, for if he were called a bare Sauiour only, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you might likly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it by ſome other ſauiour, but here he is called ſaluation it ſelfe, to ſhewe that there is no other: for there be more ſauiours but no more ſaluations, and there is manie wayes to death, and yet but one death. The braſen ſerpent was a figure of Chriſt, that <note place="margin">Num. 21. Iohn 3.</note> they which are ſtong by ſinne, by fire, and by the ſerpent which beguiled <hi>Euah,</hi> may make ſpeede, becauſe there is no remedie but to come to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The Papiſts haue found out many ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they haue found out a ſaluation by Saints, a ſaluation by Angels, a ſaluation by Maſſes, a ſaluation by merits, a ſaluation by Idols, as though Chriſt had leaſt to do in his owne office, for they haue other ſaluations to flie vnto. They will haue it, but they wil buy it, and what will they giue for it? whie they will faſt ſo many dayes, go ſo farre on pilgrimages, hire prieſtes to ſay ſo manie Maſſes, build ſo manie Abbeys, and giue ſo many ſummes of money to the Monks and Friers. Therfore this ſcripture goeth againſt them, &amp; doth diſhonor their ſhameleſneſſe, who like <hi>Nemrod</hi> heaping ſtone vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtone, <note place="margin">Gen. 11.</note> would haue built vp to heauen: ſo they heape ſinne vpon ſinne, and euerie houre
<pb facs="tcp:135771:21"/> ſome one hereſie or ſuperſtition groweth vp from this filthie roote, for what Papiſt dare ſay that <hi>Simeon</hi> thought on any of theſe or put confidence in anie other Sauiour but only in him who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he embraced in his armes? for ſaluation is by the promiſe of God, and all promiſes are in Chriſt. And though <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.</note> wanted bread, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> wanted not mony, <note place="margin">Gen. 42.</note> therefore he gaue them backe againe their money, &amp; likewiſe he gaue them that corne that they would haue bought with it: ſo I would wiſh them to ſay as <hi>Ioſephs</hi> brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they haue their corne for nothing, and had their money too, ſo let them be content to ſay, that they haue mercie for nothing &amp; their works too. For god careth not for their workes, becauſe they profit not him but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues. For there is no water can waſh <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2. Kings 5.</note> but Iordan, no water can waſh the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie of ſinne, but the bloud of the Lambe. By this the Iſraelites were ſaued when the <note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> deſtroyer paſſed by. By this the Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs to be his people, and by this the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill knoweth vs to be none of his. As it is proper vnto God to be called goodneſſe, ſo is it proper vnto Ieſus Chriſt to be called ſaluation He is called the way, the truth and <note place="margin">Iohn 14.</note> the life, for that life which we haue is but a ſparke and ſhadow of life, but he is the true
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:135771:21"/> and eternall life. Then ſeeing Chriſt is both our righteouſneſſe, ſaluation, and alſo the way, the truth and the life, to leade vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. It is as poſſible for vs without Chriſt to be righteous or ſaued, as it is to be wiſe without wiſedome, righteous without righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, or ſaued without ſaluatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs not be aſhamed to take our water from the fountaine, ſeeing Chriſt is the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all wiſedome, of all righteouſneſſe, of all truth, of all knowledge, of all ſaluation, and briefly of all goodneſſe: therefore there is no other Arke to ſaue vs from the floud, no other ladder to aſcend with into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, no other <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to feed vs in the famine, no other <hi>Moſes</hi> to lead vs through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

Life is come, and light and ſaluation: life to the dead, light to the blind, and ſaluation to the damned. For Chriſt is called ſaluation, to ſhew that without him we are all dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned firebrands of hell, heires of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and forſaken of God. To him that is ſicke, it is eaſie to be thankfull when he is whole, but when he is whole it is harder to be thankfull then to be ſicke. I would faine be diſproued, that Niniueh might be ſaued though <hi>Ionah</hi> would not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thy ſaluation.</hi> This word ſaluation is a ſweet word, yea the ſweeteſt word in all the Scripture, and yet many deſpiſe this worthy iewell, becauſe they knowe not what it is worth, like the dawes which would rather haue a barley corne, then a pearle or a iewell becauſe they know not the value thereof. O Lord what is man that thou art ſo mindfull <note place="margin">Pſal. 8.</note> of him? O man what is God that thou art ſo vnmindfull of him? If a friend had giuen vs
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:135771:22"/> anie thing, we would haue thanked him heartely for it, but to him that hath giuen vs all things, we will not giue ſo much as thankes. Now therefore let the rocke guſh forth water againe, and let our ſtonie hearts powre foorth ſtreames of teares in vnfayned repentance. We haue all called vpon you, but none regardeth vs, as though God were as <hi>Baall,</hi> and as though <hi>Diues</hi> felt no paine, nor <hi>Lazarus</hi> no ioy, but all forgotten.

               <p>If God had not loued vs better then we loued our ſelues, we ſhould haue periſhed long ere this, and yet we embrace not Chriſt as <hi>Simeon,</hi> who hath ſaued vs from tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and ſpirituall puniſhments.

Euerie thing was prepared for him before he came to be reuealed, he came not in the beginning, nor in the ending, he came not in the ending, that we which come after him might long for his ſecond comming. He came not in the beginning, becauſe that ſuch a Prince as he ſhould haue manie banners and triumphs before him. He came not in the beginning, becauſe the eyes of faith ſhould not be daſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in him, and leſt they ſhould forget him, and his comming ſo long ſince which liued in the latter ages, euen as you forget that which I haue ſayd as ſoone as you are gone hence.

               <p>The Iewes thought that he ſhould come like ſome great Prince, with po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe &amp; glorie, which was a carnal conceipt, for herein they were maruelouſly deceiued, his father was but a poore carpenter, and his mother but a ſimple woman, and he a ſillie babe wrapt in clouts. Then ought not we to reuerence our Lord and to praiſe his name, for that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo humble for vs moſt vile wretches that are worthie of nothing? and yet we ſee how cruelly they dealt with this bleſſed one which came to ſaue them. Ignorance ſate in the chaire, deceipt gaue the ſentence, and crueltie executed him, with the moſt pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full &amp; ſhamefull death of the croſſe. O that your eyes do not daſell, &amp; your eares tingle, and your hearts maruell at this dealing of theirs to our louing Sauiour which came to ſaue them if they would, and now ſee that he will abaſe him ſelf for our ſakes euen to the vttermoſt, ô wonderfull thing to thinke of.

But you that come hither for faſhions ſake, either to ſee or beſeene, to finde fault with ſomewhat, or to make an hypocritical ſhew of godlineſſe where there is none. I tell you that comfort ſhall ſhake hands with you at the dore, marke it, and you ſhall ſee that my wordes are true. Shewe me what it is that is better then ſaluation. I would haue none of you to be damned if I might preuent it, nor ſo much as a peece of you to be giuen to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, therefore I would I knew that ſtone that would kill <hi>Goliah,</hi> for I would ſtrike it with all my might into his temples.

               <p>You haue heard <hi>Simeon</hi> ſhewing the cauſe why the Sonne was ſent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Father, why he became man which raigned before in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice. What moued God to leaue his ioy and his bliſſe, and ſuffer more then all the world could ſuffer together? A great cauſe it is that would make a king leaue his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and fal to beggerie. A great and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull cauſe it was that made Iehouah to come downe from heauen to ſuffer miſerie vpon the earth. Two cauſes <hi>Simeon</hi> ſheweth why this Meſſias came from heauen. The firſt, that he might enlighten the Gentiles, which ſate in darkneſſe, and the ſecond, that he might be the glorie of Iſraell, which glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in their ſacrifices &amp; in their ceremonies, and ſo had no glorie before he came, but
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:135771:28"/> were like the Moone when the Sunne doth ſhine vpon it, or like <hi>Rachel</hi> which deſpiſed <hi>Lea</hi> and became barren. And they deſpiſed <note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> the Gentils light, like that ſonne which was angrie becauſe his loſt brother came home <note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> againe, or like thoſe labourers which chec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the Lord of the vineyard, becauſe he gaue vnto the other labourers more then he <note place="margin">Mat. 20.</note> gaue vnto them. But the Gentiles are like <note place="margin">Gen. 29.</note> 
                  <hi>Lea,</hi> who being deſpiſed became frutefull. <hi>Simeon</hi> reioyced in Chriſt, not onely for that he was the glorie of Iſraell, but alſo for that he was the light of the Gentiles. Shall the head be ſorowfull becauſe the hand is well? nay rather the hand ſhould be glad becauſe the head is well, and the head becauſe the hand is well. The father ſhould be glad be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his ſonne is ſtronger then himſelfe, the mother ſhould be glad becauſe her daughter is wiſer then her ſelfe, the brother ſhould be glad becauſe his brother is richer then him ſelfe, the miſtreſſe ſhould reioyce becauſe her mayd is a better houſwife then her ſelfe. But we enuie our brethren and our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, becauſe they are better then we, and becauſe God hath bleſſed them with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall or ſpiritual things aboue vs: if we ſee that they haue learning, then we enuy them for their learning, if he haue more gifts, we
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:135771:29"/> enuie him for his giftes, if he haue more knowledge we enuie him for his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, if he haue more zeale we enuie him for his zeale, if he haue more riches we enuy him for his riches, and how can we reioyce when euery bodies good is our euill, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie bodies ioy is our ſorow? But fixe your eyes vpon Chriſt alone, and he will fulfill your ioy, if you looke not backe to Sodome like <hi>Lots</hi> wife. If you loue ioy and gladneſſe, <note place="margin">Gen. 19.</note> Chriſt is ioy &amp; gladneſſe, if thou loue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, why Chriſt is the comforter of all that beare his croſſe, if thou loue life, Chriſt is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life, if thou loue peace, Chriſt is peace, if thou loue riches, Chriſt is full of heauenly riches, and full of liberalitie to beſtow them vpon all ſuch as loue God: ſo Chriſt is all in all vnto the godly, &amp; they haue more ioy in Chriſt alwayes and in all things, then the richeſt, and glorious, and ſumptuous Prince in the world, then <hi>Salomo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> him ſelfe had in worldly riches, honors, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, eaſe or felicitie. For the wicked which put their truſt in riches, &amp; make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gods of gold and money, eaſe and pleaſures, though they do all that they can to fulfil their luſts, and take neuer ſo much pleaſures, and be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſo merrie, yet they can haue no true ioy, nor no peace of conſcience, for all the peace,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:135771:29"/> the mirth &amp; ſport they haue, is but deceipt, all falſe and indurable, like the graſſe, greene in the morning and withered ere night. But when the Lord doth knocke at their hearts, and ſtrike them with a feeling of their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible tranſgreſſions, as no doubt he wil, then they are all in a maze, and they can haue no <note place="margin">Iſa 48. and 58.</note> ioy, no peace, no reſt, but they may ſay, in laughter my ſoule is ſorowfull, in eaſe my ſoule hath trouble, in mirth mone, in riches pouertie, in glorie ſhame, in life my ſoule is euen dead, in plentie my ſoule wanteth all things wherein it ſhould reioyce, it is deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of all comfort, and poſſeſſed with all ſlauiſh feares like <hi>Cain,</hi> who being Lord of <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> all the earth, yet had no ioy in it when God had once forſaken him.

As for example, that the world ſhould be made of nothing, that the word became fleſh, that God and man was ioyned together in one bodie, then one man may be righteous in the righteouſnes of another which is Chriſt, and that the dead ſhall riſe againe, theſe ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med fooliſhneſſe vnto the Gentiles, neither could they beleeue them. No more can ſome Gentiles amongſt vs at this day, which are but naturall men, therefore they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue them: for when they profeſſed them ſelues to be wiſe they became fools, ſaith the holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>So then we ſee nowe what Chriſt hath <note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> done for vs, he hath bounde that ſerpent, which hath ſowen all the tares, ſo that the deuill is faine for want of better lodging, to enter into ſwine.</p>

Then the Gentiles receiued more grace then they deſired, for the Lord came vncalled into their houſes, and made a feaſt vnto them in their owne houſes. The light of the Gentiles is our light, your light, and my light: Chriſt is our grace, your grace, &amp; my grace, and Chriſt is our ſaluation, your ſaluation, and my ſaluation. He came vnto the Iewes, &amp; for the Iewes, and yet his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vnto the Gentiles was better then to the Iewes. He came into the world when the world did abound in all wickedneſſe, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vs when we moſt deſerued wrath. Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at this you that wonder at nothing, that the Lord would come to bring ſaluation, to redeeme our loſt ſoules, euen as it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our willes: ſo that now we would not be as we were for a thouſand worlds.

For, the comming of Antichriſt, the ouerthrow of kingdomes, the darkneſſe of Poperie, the light of the Goſpell, the conuerſion of the Gentiles, and the reiecting of the Iewes, all theſe are ſet downe in the ſcriptures, and yet we can not vnderſtand it, though we heare it day by day, becauſe we do not giue our minds to vnderſtanding. Such hearers ſhall ſtand in a maze before the righteous &amp; ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible throne of God: the dead ſhall riſe, the trumpe ſhall blow, and all the world ſhal be in an vprore, and they ſhall ſtand quaking, when their hearing without profiting ſhall be layd to their charge, and they ſhall ſay, ô we haue knowne no ſuch things: but ſurely if the Iewes could come out of hell, they wold admoniſh vs to take better heed how we heare: for we heare as though we did not heare at all, our minds are otherwiſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied. Now when we ſee any thing come
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:135771:34"/> come to paſſe as it is foretold in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, then we muſt ſay as Chriſt ſayd, this prophecie is fulfilled, for all things that are written are come to <hi>ſcriptum eſt &amp; factum eſt,</hi> that is, as ſure as it is written, ſo ſurely doth it come to paſſe. It prophecieth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which truely is fulfilled in due time, and the more often it ſpeakes of a thing, the more certaine, the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and the more to be beleeued it is. Like a iewell that is beſet with pearle, ſo is our calling ordained with ſcriptures for ſo doth God tender our calling, which is ſo often in his mouth, and we ſo often in his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, that he ſpeaketh of vs in euery book throughout the whole ſcriptures, like a kind ſpouſe whoſe loue is in a ſtraunge countrey, and he delighteth him ſelfe with thoughts and meditations of her: ſo he did long vntil the Gentiles were come to him againe, like the prodigall child, whoſe father did long <note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> vntill he had imbraced him. When ſhal my prodigall ſonne come home againe ſaith he? I will put my beſt garment on his backe, &amp; my gold ring vpon his finger, and his fare ſhall be the daintieſt morſel. And thus God longeth for our ſaluation, and he knocketh at our doores, Is faith here? is loue here? is one called the feare of God in this place?
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:135771:34"/> And as loue maketh louers ſometime to ſpeake plainly and familiarly one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſometime by darke ſpeeches and rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, ſometime by letters, ſometime by dumbe ſhewes and ſignes, and ſometime to hide them ſelues one from another: ſo our God ſpeaketh ſometimes playnely vnto his Church, ſometime darkely and myſtically, ſomtime he turneth his face fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his Church and deare ſpouſe, as though he would not ſpeake vnto her for loue as appeareth in the booke of the Canticles.</p>

               <p>The fift type of figure was <hi>Lea,</hi> which <note place="margin">Gen. 29.</note> was ſquint eyed, and was deſpiſed, becauſe ſhe was not ſo faire and ſo well fauoured as her ſiſter <hi>Rachell,</hi> and yet the Lord made her frutefull and <hi>Rachell</hi> barren: ſo we being deſpiſed for our barrenneſſe in all goodnes, yet the Lord in mercie made vs fruteful and reuiued vs.</p>
               <p>The ſixt figure was <hi>Manaſſes</hi> &amp; <hi>Ephraim</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 48.</note> the two ſonnes of <hi>Ioſeph, Manaſſes</hi> was the eldeſt, and <hi>Ephram</hi> was the yongeſt.

Thus the Lord bleſſed vs when there was no hope left for vs.</p>
               <p>The ſeuenth figure was <hi>Rahab</hi> a harlot <note place="margin">Ioſua 2.</note> in Iericho, who was a Gentile, yet her heart was touched ſo, that ſhe receiued and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the ſpies that Iſraell ſent, and in the time of danger hid them, that they ſhould take no harme, ſignifying thereby, that the

               <p>The eight figure was <hi>Ruth</hi> a Moabite, of her Chriſt Ieſus vouchſafed to come as <note place="margin">Ruth. 4.</note> concerning the fleſh, to ſhew that he came not onely of the Iewes and for the Iewes, but alſo of and for the Gentiles, which were the loſt ſheepe, vnhoped for, being ſtrangers fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the couenant.</p>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:135771:36"/> vs vpon the Iewes, who had the knowledge of the law of God, but eſteemed it not, but were vnthankfull for it. Manie like exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples there are in the new Teſtament: like as the Cherubins, though ſeuered in ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der, yet looked one towards another, and both vpon the mercie ſeate: ſo the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the new looke looke one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp; yet point at one and the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>The firſt type or figure in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament <note place="margin">Matt. 2.</note> was the wiſe men, which were the firſt fruits of the Gentiles, and came from the Eaſt, being guided by a ſtarre: ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by the guiding of the worde and ſpirit of God, the Gentiles ſhould come from all the places of the world to imbrace Chriſt Ieſus with ioy.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Type or figure was Chriſt <note place="margin">Matt. 2</note> himſelfe, his going into Egypt, ſignifying thereby that he ſhould go from the Iewes to the Gentiles, becauſe the Iewes refuſed him through vnbeleefe, abundance of wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, and want of reformation: ſo we ſee that nothing can driue awaite Chriſt but ſinne.</p>
               <p>The third Type was Chriſt whipping <note place="margin">Mat. 21. 12</note> the Iewes out of the temple, ſhewing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that the Iewes ſhould be whipped or caſt out of the ſpiritual temple, &amp; the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles

               <p>The fourth figure is the parable of the vineyard, which was taken from them that <note place="margin">Mat. 21. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The fift figure was the parable of the two <note place="margin">Mat. 22. verſ. 18.</note> ſonnes that were bidden to go and worke in their fathers vineyard, of whom the firſt ſaid he would and did not: the ſecond ſaid he would not, and did repent, and went to labor in the vineyard: the firſt ſignified the Iewes, which made many vowes with ſuch a ſhew of godlineſſe which was but hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, whom the Lord reiected and caſt off, and ſaid, that the publicanes and ſinners ſhould ſtand in iudgement to condemne the greateſt of them.</p>
               <p>The ſixt figure, was the feaſt that the <note place="margin">Mat. 22. 2.</note> Lord made vnto the diſobedient gueſtes which the Lord inuited to his banket, and was onely ordained for them, and promiſed to come vnto it, and yet refuſed and would not come, but alledged ſlieght excuſes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from their loue of earthlie and tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie things aboue God. Therefore the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:135771:37"/> Lord ſent into the hie waies to call and compell the Gentiles to come, which came though they left their wedding garments behind them.</p>
               <p>The 7. Tipe or figure was the viſion of <note place="margin">Acts. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Ioppa,</hi> when he was on the top of the houſe, where he ſaw the veſſel come downe that had in it all maner of foure foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beaſts of the earth, and wilde beaſts, and foules of the aire, and creeping things, where alſo the voice ſaid vnto him, <hi>Ariſe Peter, kill and eat:</hi> wherein the Lord ſhewed vnto him, that he ſhould count no man vncleane, although the Gentiles then were counted vncleane, as were the vncleane beaſts ſet downe in the law of God, and therefore when <hi>Peter</hi> was ſent for to <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> houſe, he ſaid, <hi>Of a truth I perceiue</hi>

               <p>Nowe all theſe prophecies are fulfilled, the blind ſee, the lame go, the dumb ſpeake, the deafe heare, the maimed worke, the deade are quickned, the leapers are cleanſed, and the poore receiue the Goſpel. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who will diſpaire, and ſay, light is not reuealed vnto me, when as he ſeeth it to be reuealed vnto whole nations? And ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne is our calling, as that in ſo manie pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the ſcripture it is foretold, whereby we ſee how dearely the Lord tendereth our ſaluation: like as a kind ſpouſe which was longed for while ſhe was in a ſtrange coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: ſo Chriſt longed for the gentiles, till they came home againe vnto him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let vs now conſider what he giueth vs, namely righteouſneſſe, and ſaluation, firſt righteouſneſſe, then ſaluation: firſt repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and then forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, the ſunne of the goſpel, leaſt we ſhould ſee heauen in hell, and light in darkneſſe, and ioy in anguiſhes.</p>
               <p>Let vs not contemne our light, or grow careleſſe of it: let vs not build with one

Chriſt is not recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the hand, if the father offering a gift do ſee the ſonne ſtretch foorth his left hand, he will withdraw his gift from him. I ſay let vs not contemne our light as the Iewes contemned their glorie. For what is light to him that will ſhut his eies againſt it? What is this light? It is ſuch a glorious light, and ſuch an excellent reuelation, that great and mightie kings haue earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee, and princes haue laid downe their crownes to reueale it. Let vs embrace this light, Let vs take &amp; put on the wedding garment, and go to the banket, vnto which a thouſand meſſengers haue inuited vs, and do alledge none excuſes, <hi>I haue married a wife, I haue bought oxen, I go to ſee a farme,</hi>

And many haue ſmothered their light ſo long, that the dampe hath put out the candle and thus they labor to bring the darkeneſſe of Egypt vpon <hi>Goſhen:</hi> ſo that their eyes haue forgotten to ſee, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie goe out of the way, becauſe they would not looke vpon the candle, and the deuill giueth to euerie one that which he wiſheth, ſo it may be for his hurt: to the bramble fire, and who can but pittie that the ſame <hi>Manna</hi> which commeth from heauen
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:135771:42"/> ſhould be poyſoned with it?</p>
            <p>The Iewes had no cauſe to enuie our light, for he gaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> glorie: he was poore, and yet he gaue them riches: he was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted baſe, and yet he made them honourable, he was contemned, and yet he made them beloued: they were full of darkneſſe, and he brought them light, but they contemned this light, and ſo procured their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.

            <p>
               <hi>The word of the Lord came vnto Ionah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I neede not ſhew the authoritie of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but concerning their ſorts and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence: there are three ſorts of Prophets. The firſt were ſuch as called vpon the name of the Lord in prayer for the people, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued an anſwer from the Lord in the peoples behalfe, of which ſort was <hi>Samuell,</hi> &amp; theſe <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Sa. 10. 9</note> were called Seers. A ſecond ſort of Prophets were ſuch as God rayſed to expou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d the law, and declare the will of God vnto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when the Prieſts and ſuch as ſhould do ſo, were ſlacke in their callings: of which ſort was <hi>Eſay, Ieremie, Ezechiell, Damell, Hoſe, Ioell, A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>os, Obadiah, Ionah,</hi> and the reſt of the holy Prophets. A third ſort were ſuch as haue beene ſince Chriſt, woorking ſuch like effectes, of which ſort was the Prophet <hi>Agabus,</hi> of whome mention is <note place="margin">Act. 11, 28.</note> made in the eleuenth of the Acts and the 28. verſe.</p>
            <p>Now in the ſecond ſort of theſe was <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> whom God ſent to declare his wil vnto his people, vnto whom alſo the Lord did reueale the ſubuerſion of kingdomes, the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:135771:43"/> ouerthrow of Tribes, the captiuitie of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and calamities that were to come vnto the ſonnes of men for iniquitie and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt God.</p>
            <p>As all wiſe men were not borne at once, nor liued togither: ſo theſe holy Prophets haue not beene at once, but were raiſed vp by the Lord God, ſome here, ſome there, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his pleaſure, and as he ſawe the people ſtand in need of them by reaſon of the corruption of the times.</p>
            <p>And furthermore, the Lord hath not at any time reuealed vnto one of theſe, all things that might be reuealed, but as much as was ſufficient for them euerie one in their times and places. Neither hath any of them told as much of the will of God as might be, nor the expounding of his lawes. But the Patriarkes haue left ſome to the Prophets, and the Prophets haue left ſome to the Apoſtles, but they haue left none for vs, but they haue all left open the whole will of GOD vnto vs, and euerie one bringeth Golde, and Myrrhe, and Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenſenſe, like the wiſe men which came to ſee our Lord.</p>
            <p>There are three things which moued me to take this ſtorie in hand aboue al others. Firſt becauſe you know the ſtorie, and therefore
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:135771:44"/> can the better conceiue of the matter as I go forward with it. Secondly becauſe it is brief and doth containe a great deale in a little. Thirdly, becauſe it is moſt agreeable for the time and ſtate of this ſinfull age wherein we liue, and therefore moſt conuenient for vs. It is manifeſt that <hi>Ionah</hi> liued in a very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome time, namely in the time of <hi>Ierobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> a wicked king, of whom it was ſaid, that he not only ſinned himſelf againſt the Lord, but it is he which is called the <hi>Ieroboa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> that made Iſraell to ſinne. Alſo this comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth the conſtancie of <hi>Ionah,</hi> that he in the midſt of all the corruptions wherwith all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ouerflowne, kept him ſelfe vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and vnſpotted amongſt them all. And furthermore it layeth open and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the great loue of God, in that he ſent a Prophet to admoniſh his vngodly people, when as he ſhould haue ſent a thunderbolt to terrifie them, or rather vtterly to deſtroy them: ſo that there mercy ſtept before iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>His name was <hi>Ionah,</hi> which ſignifieth a doue, which admoniſheth vs, that as we la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be as wiſe as ſerpents, ſo we ſhould alſo deſire that we might be as ſimple as doues. His fathers name was <hi>Amittai,</hi> which ſignifieth truth. I would that truth were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:135771:44"/> preachers father.</p>
            <p>There are three ſpeciall things contained in this hiſtorie. Firſt, the great mercie of God, expreſſed in this, that he ſent a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to Niniuie a Citie of the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tils, which were ſtrangers from the couenant, from the promiſe, and ſtraungers from the common wealth of Iſraell.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing was <hi>Ionah,</hi> who being no Gentile but an Iſraelite, which knew his maiſters will what it was, did yet preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly neglect the ſame, not of a ſudden deſire, for he had time inough to conſider what he did, and yet ſee what mercie did: the Lord prepared a great whale in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of the ſea, where there was no hope of life for him: afterwards the Lord hauing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered him out of the whales bellie, he went and preached at Niniuie ſo zealouſly, as though he had neuer bene the man which was ſo diſobedient before. And when he had done, he murmured againſt God worſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> euer he did, and all becauſe he ſpared the citie.</p>
            <p>The third thing was, the mariners which had bene idolaters all their liues, yet now by the great power of God mouing them, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon the true God, of whom they had heard by <hi>Ionah,</hi> &amp; by whoſe mightie power
<pb facs="tcp:135771:45"/> they were ſaued.</p>
            <p>But in the meane while, <hi>Niniuie</hi> ſet on the ſcore, and had no ho with them in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wickedneſſe: but ſtill filling the cup of all abhominations, and running downe to hel with as much ſpeed and force as they could, and no ſtay but the perill of death. And <hi>Ionah,</hi> he rebelleth againſt God, for being ſent to <hi>Niniuie,</hi> he went to <hi>Tarſhiſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are foure ſpeciall things to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Ionah.</hi> Firſt, the daunger of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> by his diſobedience. Secondlie, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour of <hi>Ionah</hi> in the whales bellie. Thirdlie, the grudging and murmuring of <hi>Ionah</hi> againſt the Lord God. And fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, the rebuking of <hi>Ionah</hi> by God for his impietie.</p>
            <p>He that receiueth a Prophet in the name of a Prophet, ſhall receyue a Prophets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Therefore let vs prepare our eares to heare and receiue the worde of God prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by his miniſters, &amp; let vs think that <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> is come againe to our houſes to preach, whether it be fortie dayes, or fortie weekes, or fortie yeares, they that liue like <hi>Sodome,</hi> ſhall be puniſhed like <hi>Sodome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The word of the Lord came to Ionah the ſonne of Amittai ſaying, Ariſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>We haue ſeene <hi>Ionah</hi> a farre off, if we

            <p>As our Sauiour ſaid to his diſciples, Pray <note place="margin">Mat. 24. 20</note> that your flight be not in the winter, nor on the Sabboth: ſo ſay I vnto you, pray that the Lordes comming be not on the weeke dayes therefore: if he did come then, howe ſhould he find you? Therefore I pray you learne now, and giue good eare that ye may<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> heare ſufficient for all the weeke.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The word of the Lord came, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein I obſerue that <hi>Ionah</hi> went not before he was ſent: for he going to preach vnto the Gentiles, it was needfull that he ſhould haue a ſpeciall calling and commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Lord himſelfe: for it was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet to caſt the childrens bread vnto dogs, vnleſſe he had a ſpeciall commaundement from God ſo to do.</p>
            <p>None ought to take vpon him the fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of preaching in the church, vnles they haue their warrant or authoritie from God, <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 4.</note> as <hi>Aaron</hi> had. And although they haue not their authoritie in that forme and maner as <hi>Ionah</hi> had his, (namely) as it were by word of mouth, euen from God himſelfe, <hi>Ariſe and go to Niniuie.</hi> Yet they muſt haue their warrant from him (elſe their calling is vnlawfull.)</p>
            <p>But now there is another authoritie crept
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:135771:46"/> into the Church that makes ſo many idols, which haue eyes and ſee not, tongues and ſpeake not, eares and heare not, and that is this. When one ſtalleth vp another into <hi>Moſes</hi> chaire, not hauing <hi>Moſes</hi> rod, nor <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpirit. And this gall will not holde ſpurring. Further I obſerue, that as the worde of the Lord came to <hi>Ionah:</hi> ſo the word of the Pope came to his prieſts, Ieſuits and Seminaries, but ſo and in ſuch ſort ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times, that they are drawne to Tiburne while Maſſes are ſaid for them at Rome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The word of the Lord came vnto Ionah. &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein alſo I obſerue, that which came vnto him was not alwayes with him, but ſo it was, that when the worde of the Lord came vnto anie of the Prophets, then they were well furniſhed with abilitie, to teach, to preach, to reproue, or to command who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer the Lord would haue ſo handled, as by example: <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet bad <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> the king that he ſhould build a temple. <note place="margin">2. Sam 1. 1. Chron. 11</note> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1. and 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. And a little after he came and bad him that he ſhould not build it. Where wee ſee that when he bad him build it, then the ſpirite of the Lord came not vnto him to bid him ſo to do. And therefore the ſpirit of God came vpon him the verie ſame night, and bad him that he
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:135771:46"/> ſhould go to <hi>Dauid,</hi> and bid him that he ſhould not build it. For this is euident, that as God himſelfe is conſtant, ſo his ſpirit and his word are conſtant, and therefore neuer faith and vnſaith one thing.</p>
            <p>Againe the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid, 2. <hi>Kin.</hi> 4. <note place="margin">2. King. 4.</note> that the Sunamites heart was grieued, but the Lord had hid it from him, and had not as then declared the ſame vnto him: which doth note vnto vs, that the ſame worde whereby the Lord hath, and doth reueale maruellous things vnto his Prophets, was not now vpon him, neither is alwayes vpon any Prophet, but according to the will of God it comes vnto them, to reueale vnto them what he would haue them to do, and when it pleaſeth him.</p>
            <p>Alſo <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaid, that the Lord did not reueale the kings dreame vnto him, for any wiſdome that he had more then any liuing, but only for the kings ſake, &amp; for the poore people of Gods ſake, and ſo you muſt think of vs that are the miniſters of the Goſpell, that the Lord doth not reueale his will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, for any wiſdome or worthineſſe that is in vs more then other men, but for your ſakes, &amp; that we might reueale it vnto you, therefore heare vs euen for that cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord hath reuealed vnto vs theſe
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:135771:47"/> things for your ſakes, and good. From the calling we come to the charge.</p>

            <p>The Iewes would not heare the word of God by <hi>Ionah,</hi> and therfore the Lord ſent to <hi>Niniuie,</hi> ſignifying thereby that the Iewes for their contempt and negligence ſhould be reiected, and the Gentiles ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued into the fauour of God, that they might be an holie &amp; ſanctified people vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord in their ſtead. Their ſinne is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this, that they ſinned euen vntill the Prophets were gone from them. Therefore this was as it were to ſhake off the duſt of their feet to witneſſe againſt them for their obſtinacie and hardneſſe of heart, and to let them ſee that the wickedeſt Gentiles were more righteous then they, that they repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the voice of one Prophet, yea &amp; with one ſermon: whereas they refuſed &amp; reſiſted all the holy and worthy Prophets that God ſent vnto them.</p>
            <p>Againe, the calling of the Gentiles is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in this their ſubmiſſion with all wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſſe, which they did ſhewe vnto the words of this prophet wheras: the Iewes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected all the words of God, and would not heare the Prophets, whom God had rayſed vp amongſt them, which made thoſe Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uits
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:135771:48"/> to proclaime a faſt, to put on ſackcloth and to humble themſelues before the Lord, deſiring him to turne away his wrath from their citie? Thus they repented, and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting were ſaued with mercie: ſo they which grieue the ſpirit, quench the ſpirit, for the worde of God went from Samaria to Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuie.</p>

            <p>Niniuie receyued the word of God, and neuer heard it before, and this ſheweth that the fooliſh &amp; ſimple are more diligent and ready to heare and receiue the word of god, than thoſe that are wiſe in their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, &amp; alſo in the view of the world.

            <p>It is ſaide that GOD worketh manie things at once. It might well be ſaid, for the mercie of God, the conuerſion of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, the reiection of the Iewes were al ſet forth herein, and yet a further matter was contained in it.</p>

            <p>Firſt God biddeth him, Ariſe and ſhake off all impediments, and then to go and call them to the battel, and now he bids him crie out againſt them, and ſo terrifie them.

            <p>If they were not deafe, they need not to crie one to another, ſuch is the dumbneſſe of preachers, the deafneſſe of hearers, and the ſlowneſſe of followers, that there is but litle good done, and but a few frutes gathered.

            <p>They that ſhould preach at Niniuie, are loytering at Tarſhiſh, and like a drone doth the Nonreſident keepe his benefice, but for ſhame wilt thou keepe it ſtill, either go and preach at Niniuie as you are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmanded,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:135771:58"/> or leaue your priuiledge and benefice. But they ſtand ſtaggering, aſhamed to keepe it, and loath to leaue off, for the ſweet mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of <hi>Bels</hi> prieſts are ſo pleaſant vnto them, that they cannot find in their harts to leaue them as long as they are able to keepe it. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> was ſent to Niniuie, but he went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Tarſhiſh. And ſo it is alwayes with vs, either we ſay or do euill, or elſe we do nothing, or we take one thing for another and ſo we are euer doing that we ſhould not do. And as <hi>Ionah</hi> tooke Tarſhiſh for Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie: ſo wee take the Deuill for an Angell, light for darkneſſe: pride for handſomneſſe: ſinne for godlineſſe: and euil for goodneſſe. No maruell it was that <hi>Ionah</hi> fled, leaſt hee ſhould go to Niniuie: for this is a ſtumbling vocation amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g men, yea hated and reiected by the children of this world, which alway <note place="margin">Exod. 18. 4.

            <p>
               <hi>But Ionah roſe vp to flie vnto Tarſhiſh from the preſence of the Lord, and went downe to Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pho, and he found a ſhip going to Tarſhiſh. So he payed the fare thereof, and went downe into it, that he might go with them vnto Tarſhiſh fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the preſence of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We haue heard how buſie Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the courſe of preaching, by perſwading <hi>Ionah</hi> (with ſuch reaſons as ſeemed ſtrong vnto fleſh and blood) that he ſhould not go to preach at Niniuie. I haue long preached vnto the Iewes, which are the choſen people of God, and ſeeing they will not heare me, it is in vaine to preach vnto theſe Gentiles, which neuer heard of God or godlines, and therefore will eſteeme my words the leſſe. Thus <hi>Ionah</hi> is loath to looſe his labour, and puts in a doubt where he needs not, becauſe he conſidered not the great power of God in mens hearts. The Niniuites are heathen people, &amp; therefore (ſaith <hi>Ionah)</hi> why ſhould I venture my ſelfe among them? for ſeeing mine owne countrimen kicke againſt my words, and cannot abide to heare the word, which commeth from the Lord to reproue ſinne, then how much more ſhall I be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:135771:59"/> by theſe, and perſecuted to death. Thus fleſh and blood ſtandeth ſtaggering whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it ſhould do any good: but when it goeth about to do anie miſchiefe, it neuer thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth nor conſidereth why or wherefore it ſhould ſin, when as it ſhould be ſorie for it before it be committed, euen as ſoone as it is thought vpon. When God commands vs to do anie thing that is holie and good, then we looke one vpon another as though we cared not who did that, like <hi>Peter</hi> when he was commanded by our Sauiour to take vp his croſſe, he asketh, what ſhall <hi>Iohn</hi> do? <note place="margin">Iohn. 21. 19. 20.</note> as if he were vnwilling, &amp; wold rather that <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhould do it then he.</p>
            <p>If I go and preach vnto theſe infidels, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet fortie dayes, and Niniuie ſhall be deſtroyed, then (ſaith <hi>Ionah)</hi> it may be they will repent, and God will haue mercie vpon them, ſo I ſhall be counted a falſe Prophet for my labour. And thus we regard our cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit more then the glorie of God: and rather then we would receiue anie reproch by our doing (in the ſight of the world,) we rather chuſe to enter into no great action touching the glory of God &amp; the good of the church. If I preach vnto the Gentiles (ſaith <hi>Ionah)</hi> I ſhal bring ſhame vpon Iſrael before all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, becauſe a Prophet is gone from them for
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:135771:59"/> their obſtinacie, chuſing rather to preach vnto vncircumciſed Gentiles then vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as if there were more hope of the Gentiles then of them. And further, if theſe Gentiles do repent at my preaching, &amp; the Lord take pitie vpon them, and receiue them to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, ſo the Iewes ſhall be reiected. Thus <hi>Ionah</hi> loueth the ſonne better the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the father. And ſurely this was a ſore temptation, to bid a man (being in reaſonable good eſtate touching his bodie and life) that he ſhould go and preach vnto a ſauage heathen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that neuer heard of preaching to tell the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that there is but one onely &amp; true God, who will ſerue a thouſand, and cannot abide the <note place="margin">Deut. 6. 4.</note> contrarie to be ſpoken.</p>
            <p>If a preacher were commanded to go and preach at Rome gates, againſt Antichriſts iuriſdiction, and the idolatrie that is ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily vſed in that ſinagogue of vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſeeing that is a matter, for which they torment and kill, all that preach it ſincerely: then I thinke that it would hardly come to paſſe at all, that this preacher would go from a reaſonable quiet eſtate touching his bodie, to venter his life among ſuch cruell tyrants, I thinke he would rather flie to Tarſhiſh fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the preſence of the Lord, if by anie poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie he might do it.</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:135771:60"/>
            <p>
               <hi>But Ionah roſe vp to flie vnto Tarſhiſh from the preſence of the Lord, and he went downe to Iapho, where he found a ſhip, and he went downe into it, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the way to Tarſhiſh, but nowe what need he to rehearſe all this? had it not bene enough to ſay, that he went to flie, and leaue his buſineſſe vndone? But all this is to ſhew the ſtubburnneſſe and diſobedience of <hi>Ionah,</hi> yet this thing was not done vpon the ſudden, but he had time enough to conſider what he did, betwixt Samaria and Iapho: he might haue conſidered what he did before he went into the hauen, and when he came to the hauen, he ſhould not haue payed the fare; &amp; when he had payd the fare, he ſhould not haue entred the ſhip; and when he came into the ſhip, he ſhould not haue hoyſed vp the ſayles to flie from God. But thus ſinne runnes on wheeles, as it were downe a hill, in all poſt haſt, and neuer ſtayes till it ariue euen in hell. Now <hi>Ionah</hi> thinketh, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he came ſafe to Iapho, therfore he may go to the hauen, therefore he may pay the fare, and becauſe he payed the fare in peace, therfore he may take ſhipping; and becauſe he entred the ſhip in ſafetie therfore he may hoyſe vp the ſailes to go; and becauſe he hoyſed vp the ſailes without danger, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:135771:60"/> he may go ſafely to Tarſhiſh.</p>
            <p>So ſinnes follow one another like linkes of a chaine, till the tempeſt of deſtruction breake it in ſunder. Therefore one ſaide, I haue ſworne and God did not puniſh me, therefore I will ſteale: I haue ſtollen, and God did not puniſh me, therefore I will kil: I haue killed and God did not puniſh me, then why may not I do what I liſt? I may do this as wel as I haue done other things here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore. <hi>Ionah</hi> confeſſeth his ſinne, that wee might confeſſe. Firſt, he confeſſeth that hee knew his maiſters will, and did it not: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, he tooke another courſe quite co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that he was commanded; but happie were <hi>Ionah</hi> if he had gone before he was made to go. If that he had conſidered with himſelfe that God is the Lord, who is allſeeing and almightie, from whom nothing can be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, he would neuer haue taken his iourney to <hi>Iapho,</hi> or when he came to <hi>Iapho</hi> he would not haue paid the fare, or when he payed the fare, hee would not haue entred the ſhip, or when he was gone into the ſhip, he would not haue hoyſt the ſayles, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would haue leapt out of that ſhip that ſhould carrie him from his God, but he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets himſelfe, thinking that the creatures can hide him from the creator, which is an <note place="margin">Heb. 4. 13.</note>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:135771:61"/> abſurd thing to thinke, ſeeing nothing can be hid from him. And ſo Niniuie is ſtill like Niniuie, but <hi>Ionah</hi> is not like <hi>Ionah,</hi> then ſin is crying, and the Prophet is flying, and ſo all falles to confuſion. All thoſe that pitie <hi>Ionah,</hi> let them pittie themſelues, for if we conſider our owne eſtate, we haue as many and as foule ſinnes in vs as there were in <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> yea or in Niniuie. But here marke the ſubtiltie of the deuill, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> he thought that if he could let <hi>Ionah</hi> from going to Niniuie by theſe former reaſons, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the goodlieſt citie in all Samaria ſhould be deſtroyed, and ſo the verie angels in heauen ſhould mourne. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Further, that if <hi>Ionah</hi> would repent &amp; turne backe from going, (being commanded) then <hi>Ionah</hi> ſhould be counted a falſe Prophet in Iſrael, and ſo a Prophet ſhould be diſcredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Further, he thought that if <hi>Ionah</hi> wold repent, he could put ſuch a Prophet out of Gods fauour, &amp; make him be deſpiſed, he thought that then he ſhould get well by his labour. So we ſee that the deuill hath power to tempt vs to ſinne, but not to force vs to ſinne. Then lo a comfort, that our enemies power is in our fathers ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: therfore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour ſaith to <hi>Peter,</hi> fatha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath deſired to ſift <note place="margin">Luke. 22. 31. 32.</note> thee and winnow thee as wheate, but I haue prayed for thee that thy faith faile thee not.
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:135771:61"/> Who is this whoſe perill Sathan ſo earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſireth? euen <hi>Peters,</hi> yea <hi>Peter</hi> an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. Was not fleſh a valiant captaine thinke you, that hath led a Prophet captiue, for who can gainſay him that commeth like an Angell? who can reſiſt him that ſeeth the whole world? will you reſiſt him, if I ſhew to you he is an hypocrite? for he ſaith, If you fall down and worſhip this world, you ſhal come to heauen: ſo he is euer alluring by deceits, ſtealing our hearts away with a vain hope of much pleaſure, becauſe he knoweth mans nature is bent to loue ſuch things: ſo his baites are pleaſures, and his ſnares are ſinnes. Whatſoeuer we do, it commeth from one of theſe three ſpirits: the ſpirit of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, the ſpirit of God, or our owne ſpirite. The ſpirit of God is gentle, louing, and meeke, not forcing nor threatning, therfore <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 16 Luke. 14. 24.</note> Chriſt ſayth, If you will follow me, then take vp this croſſe: and marke his ſpirite, he ſayth not you ſhall follow, but ſayth, if you will follow me. That order is obſerued in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> where he ſaith, Open vnto me, <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 2.</note> my ſiſter, my ſpouſe, &amp;c. And then if ſhe did not open vnto him he went his way mildly, <note place="margin">Cant. 5. 5.</note> without any threats. The ſpirit of Sathan takes another courſe: for when by lying &amp; deceit he cannot allure vs to ſin, he threatens
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:135771:62"/> vs with ſinne, griefe, or loſſe of goods, ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarineſſe or loſſe of pleaſure, and ſometime by his miniſters, lims of his owne likeneſſe working, he threatneth death and earthly torments, ſuch as they can inflict vpon any. Chriſt ſaith, If you will follow me, take vp <note place="margin">Mat. 1. 16.</note> this croſſe, if you will: but he ſayth, I will make you follow me, and do as I bid you, or you ſhall ſmart for it, you ſhal haue fire and fagot, ſcalding lead and burning pitch, if you will not follow me, I will take all from you, and make you to do as we commaund, and ſo doth his eldeſt ſon Antichriſt, which v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>urpeth an authoritie ouer nations, infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting torments on the ſaints. Now our own ſpirit is euermore hard: if it be moued by the ſpirit of God, it is ſad, ſoft and ſlow, but if it be mooued by the ſpirit of Sathan, it is proude, boy ſterous and ſtout. All good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that we feele in our ſelues are the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſpirit of God, although they ſeem vnto vs as proceeding from our ſelues, for the ſpirit of God worketh in, and moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth our ſpirits. The ſpirit of man is always toſſed betweene theſe two ſpirits which are euer contrarie one to another. The ſpirit of man when it is alone, is alwayes occupied about worldly things: the ſpirit of God is alwayes occupied about our ſaluation. And
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:135771:62"/> the ſpirit of Sathan is euer occupied in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing our condemnation &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, iudge wiſely of the fall of <hi>Ionah,</hi> not raſhly condemning him for his fault, for although <hi>Dauid</hi> ioyned murther with adulterie, yet he repented, and is the deare child of God.</p>

He made me beleeue that light could be brought out of darkneſſe, that good may come of euill, for he aſſured me, that if I would ſet forth toward Tarſhiſh, I ſhould not onely ſhun the preſence of the Lord, but ſhould liue at eaſe like one vnknowne, both for my voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and alſo for my behauiour in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therof, and ſo I might creepe into a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie with theſe people, and enioye the benefit of their ſocietie. Otherwiſe if I went to Niniuie as the Lord commaunded, they would hate and perſecute me, yea and ſo I ſhould end my life in miſerie, both becauſe they being Gentiles and I a Iew, they can not abide me, for the one holdeth the other in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tempt: and alſo becauſe of my meſſage, namely a Prophecie of deſtruction, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon a reproofe of their vile and ſinne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full pleaſures. Which meſſage, Sathan per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded me that it would be ſo hainouſly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, that no death nor torment that they could deuiſe for me would be thought ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, &amp; ſo I ſhould be ſure neuer to eſcape
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:135771:66"/> their hands aliue if I we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as though the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and moſt glorious God which ſent me thither, were not able to defend me from all euill when I come thether, as well as he did <hi>Damell</hi> in the den of Lyons, and <hi>Iohn</hi> in the Iſle of Pathmos among the ſauage beaſtes. And when Satha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had thus perſwaded me, I beleeued him, &amp; ſo tooke my iourney to fly fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the preſence of the Lord (if I could haue performed my inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion.) But the Lord who ſeeing the ſtubburneſſe and diſobedience of my heart, followed me with great diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſending ſuch a te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peſt vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſea wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I was, that it had like to ouerwhelmed vs all, and ſo neare as I was to the water, ſo neare I was to death by all likelihood.</p>
               <p>Thus Sathan perſwadeth vs as he did <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> he ſaith to vs as he ſaid to Chriſt, if you will fall downe and worſhip me, I will giue <note place="margin">Luke. 4. 7.</note> you all things you would haue: if you will leaue the ſocietie, the exerciſes, the profeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the companie of the children of God, and of the ſeruice of God, and ſerue me, and worſhip me, in preferring your couetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, your pride, your enuie, your luſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſeruice of God, then you ſhall grow rich, and you ſhall not be ſo ſcrupulous to ſweare for your gaine ſometime, or to lye for your pleaſure, and to coſin for riches, and
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:135771:67"/> you ſhall haue good lucke, and ſhall haue euery thing at your hearts deſire. But if we do his will, we ſhall ſpeede as <hi>Ionah</hi> did, we ſhall haue the wrath and vengeance of God vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our heads: for he hath nothing to giue vs, although he makes vs beleeue we ſhall haue great kingdomes. Yes we ſhall haue hell for our reward, which wil make al their hearts to ake which receaue it, other reward he hath none. So the deuill is alwayes a very ſeruiceable and pleaſant deuill to ſuch as fly from God: he can finde occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s at all times, and meanes and inſtrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts fit for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. If thou wilt fly from God, the deuill will lend you both ſpurres, and a horſe, (yea a poſt horſe) that will carrie you ſwiftlie &amp; luſtilie away vnto all vanitie and vngodlie luſts. But ſee what <hi>Ionah</hi> got by his iourney, notwithſtanding all the furtherances that Sathan could worke for him, he loſt his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, loſt his ioy, loſt his credit, and almoſt loſt his life too. Thus we ſee in <hi>Ionah</hi> what it profiteth a man to flye fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and practiſing the euill motions and te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations of Sathan in ſteed of the knowen will of God, for the very dumbe creatures were bent againſt him for his diſobedience: the wind blowes as though it would ouer turne all, the waters roare as though they
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:135771:67"/> will drowne all, the ſhip reeles and tumbles as though ſhe were wearie of all, &amp; the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners crie and caſt out their wares apace, as though they would looſe all: And yet the wind could not ouerthrow him, nor the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters drowne him, nor the whale eat him; and thus <hi>Ionah</hi> fled from God but not God from <hi>Ionah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Lord ſent out a great wind into the ſea, and there was a great tempeſt, ſo that the ſhip was like to be broken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt God ſpake gentlie to him, <hi>Ariſe Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah, go to Niniuie:</hi> then he would not go, but ſeeing wordes would not ſerue, the Lord would take another way, and try whether that could make him obedient to his voice. So the Lord cauſed a mightie tempeſt to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in the ſea, which ſet them all in a maze, and made them examine both whence the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peſt came, &amp; alſo wherefore, or for whoſe ſake it troubled them ſo ſore, that <hi>Ionah</hi> might ſee (at the leaſt) if he would ſee it, that the vegea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of God doth alwayes acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany the ſtubburne and diſobedient whither ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they go: and for the acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſhment ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, that all the creatures of God are bent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, to moleſt trouble, and croſſe them in their euill wayes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God ſent a great wind.</hi>

               <p>He that made the windes, commaunded <note place="margin">Pſal. 141. 18 Iſa. 13.</note> them, and they obey his voyce: the wind &amp; the waters obey him, but man will not obey him. He ſaith not, that a wind aroſe, but ſaith, The Lord ſent a great wind; then it was not by chance, nor yet by witchcraft, for the mariners (notwithſtanding they were infidels) were not ſo groſſe as to aſcribe it vnto anie ſuch cauſe, but rather thought it to be ſent from ſome reuenging power, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prouoked to indignation by ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon among them, that had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſome hainous fact: elſe why did they caſt lots, to know him and find him out that had ſinned, and whoſe ſinne did procure the tempeſt to be ſent? Though this tempeſt had almoſt drowned <hi>Ionah,</hi> yet he ſaith, the Lord ſent it: ſo the Lord ſendeth wind to bring ſhips to land in ſafetie, and the ſame Lord ſendeth tempeſts to drown, &amp; breake, and ſincke other ſhips. Therefore <hi>Iob</hi> ſayd when he was bereft of all his ſubſtance at once, and left as poore as might be, that the Lord had taken them from him (which alſo gaue all to him,) adding alſo a tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>kſgiuing <note place="margin">Iob. 1. 21.</note> euen for the perſecuting ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of God, which did ſo moleſt him. If ſome had ſo much loſſe by tempeſt as <hi>Iob,</hi> and ſuch danger as <hi>Ionah,</hi> they would ſurely ſay with <hi>Iob, Bleſſed be
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:135771:68"/> the name of the Lord for it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the wind blowes, the water toſſes, the whale ſwims, &amp; all to meet <hi>Ionah</hi> which flies from God, to ſee if they can turne his hart which ſleeps in diſobedience. The ſhip goes roundly for a time, the Prophet is ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, the mariners are ſporting, their ſailes flaunting, the waters calming, the windes guiding, ſo merily ſinne goes on before the tempeſt comes. The wind blowes not yet, therfore go on yet a litle, &amp; yet a little more, but yet the tempeſt ruſhes vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them before they be ware of it, and tumbles them vp and downe, &amp; ſuddenly all is like to be vndone. Now <hi>Ionah</hi> is in more danger then the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuites. And now, ó that he had ſtayed at home and ſaued his money, ſaued his credit, &amp; ſaued his life from the danger of the furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous &amp; vnmerciful ſtreame. Here we may ſee what paines a ſinner takes, &amp; all to hurt him ſelfe. He came to the hauen, and payd the fare, and entred the ſhip, and hoiſt vp ſailes, and went on forward, and all to flie from God, and yet he fled not from him but to him. Therfore <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, if I take the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">Pſal. 139. 7. 8. 9.</note> wings and flie aloft, lo thou art there, if I go into the neathermoſt depth, thy hand will find me out: therefore whither ſhall I flie from thee? ſo that when we thinke that
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:135771:69"/> we flie from God, in running out of one place into another, we do but run from one hand to the other, for there is no place where Gods hand is not, and whither ſoeuer a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious ſinner doth run, the hand of God wil meet with him to croſſe him, and hinder his good ſucceſſe, although he prophecieth neuer ſo much good vnto him ſelfe in his iourney. The winds could not further <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> the waters could not beare him, his ſleep could not ſaue him, the ſhip could not hold him, the mariners could not helpe him, the whale would not ſpare him, but he poore man muſt be caſt out, leſt all through him be caſt away. The ſhip that was full of wares of great value, was readie to ſinke when <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi> entred into it. He truſted to the winds, and the winds could not further him; he tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to the waters, and the waters could not beare him; he truſted to the ſhip, the ſhip could not hold him; he truſted to the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the mariners could not help him. What had he offended the winds, or the waters, or what had he offended the ſhip that bare him ſuch enmitie? The winds and the waters, and <note place="margin">Iob. 5. 23.</note> all Gods creatures, are to take Gods part a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Ionah</hi> or anie other rebellious ſinner.</p>
               <p>Though God in the beginning gaue power to ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; authoritie ouer all his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures

               <p>The effectes, that this great tempeſt wrought were theſe. The ſhip was like to be broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; the mariners were ſore affrayd.

But when they begin to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that theſe wil not helpe, which they in all the time of their proſperity repoſed their confidence in, and made more account off then God, then they begin to crouch and kneele, &amp; to ſeeke out the true God in hope of releefe. If thou canſt heale thy ſelfe, what
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:135771:73"/> needeſt thou a phiſitian? or if thou canſt help thy ſelfe out of troubles, what neede haſt thou of ſuccour? Therefore theſe mariners ſeeing that they could not helpe themſelues, cried vnto their gods, and laboured with all their ſtrength that they might not be caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Firſt they vſed prayer vnto the diuine powers for aſſiſtance: then they vſed ſuch ordinarie meanes as they knew beſt in ſuch a time, by caſting out their wares to lighten the ſhip of them, which rule is neceſſaire to be vſed of all Chriſtians in their neceſſitie: <note place="margin">In neceſſitie firſt pray, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vſe law, full meanes.</note> firſt to ſeeke for ayde and aſſiſtance at the hands of God, and then to vſe all ſuch good meanes to helpe them ſelues, as God ſhal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to do, truſting that of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he will bleſſe their endeuors, elſe may they go ouer all the world to ſeeke helpe &amp; haue none, for there is no other way. God in deed is laſt refuge, but he is alſo the firſt refuge which is to be ſought vnto, for he is Alpha and Omega, the firſt and the laſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And cried eueryman vnto his God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They did wel in that they prayed, but they prayed not well, for they prayed euery man vnto his god, that is, vnto fayned gods, gods in name but not in nature, &amp; ſuch gods they were, as could not helpe ſo much as them ſelues.</p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:135771:73"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they cried.</hi> Which ſheweth that their gods were deafe and could not heare them, no more then they could helpe them. Here is a diſtinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in prayer: the righteous pray when they are in need, but the vngodly rore and crie like beares without their pray, for they diſpaire of helpe before they pray for it. <hi>Euerie ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto his god.</hi> They prayed much like the Papiſts, which in extremitie cry out <note place="margin">Papiſtes to their ſundrie Saints.</note> ſome to one ſaint, ſome to another, ſome to ſaints ſome to Angels, for they thinke, if one will not helpe another will. But true prayer hath two wings, betweene which it muſt be carried vp to heauen, elſe it cannot aſcend at <note place="margin">Prayers wings to bring it to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: faith and loue.</note> all, namely faith and loue, without which no prayer can be acceptable or amiable before God. Theſe cried and prayed, &amp; their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers did beate the skie, but could not lay the tempeſt, yet their prayer is here noted, to ſhew the cuſtome of naturall men: for the heathen do wel perceiue that there is a God, (nature and experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce doth teach it them,) who hath made the ſtately and moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous frame of the world, with all the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent creatures therein, yet they know him not. For though the lamps be waſted ſince <hi>Adam</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſulted with the deuil that he might be a God, yet there is a litle light which ſtill dwelleth in darkneſſe, like a ſparke hid in
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:135771:74"/> aſhes. They would not haue prayed at all, but that nature taught them that there is a God, whoſe mightie power they beheld ſo expreſly in all the creatures, that they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined it to be impoſſible for one God to worke them all: therfore they thought that there were diuerſe gods as there were diuerſe ſeaſons, diuerſe nations, diuerſe trades, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe languages, diuerſe and ſundry kinds of all things; and ſo diuerſe nations worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped diuerſe gods. Euerie of theſe mariners did now in their extremitie call vpon his god, euerie one vpon that god which he thought moſt highly off, and in whom he hath in his proſperitie repoſed moſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. And now while none could help but <note place="margin">Seeking to lay the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it.</note> one, they cried to many, and by this meanes while they ſought to lay the tempeſt, they ſtirred it more: for their prayers being ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous, were ſo wicked, that it had bene ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prouoke the Lord vtterly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them, if his mercie were not wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <note place="margin">Pſal. 144. 15.</note> ouer all his works, therefore bleſſed is he that hath the Lord for his God. What trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſoeuer commeth vnto the child of God, yet he hath ſome conſolation, patience, and moderation of mind, to beare it withall, but when the Lord ſendeth aduerſitie vnto the vngodly, they haue ſuch a guiltie conſcience,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:135771:74"/> that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they feele the great hand of God, they are euen diſtracted of their wits, and made as it were ſenſleſſe, that they know not what they do: yea when trouble comes, it makes them like a heedleſſe bee, which buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeth about ſhe knowes not whither, or like the ſwallow, which by compulſion of the wind, flyeth backward &amp; forward till it fall into the ſea, or like <hi>Cain</hi> whoſe head was giddie, that he knew not whither to go, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to be ſlaine of euery one whom he <note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> ſeeth.</p>

                  <hi>And caſt the wares out that were in the ſhip into the ſea.</hi>

               <p>Now the mariners are content to caſt their wares into the ſea, in hope of ſome furtherance to ſaue their liues thereby, for though many will venter their liues for riches, yet they rather part with all their riches then their liues.

If you marke what is ſaid vnto you, you are a ſleepe though your eyes be open, and if you were as wiſe as <hi>Ionah,</hi> you would not ſleepe here in the ſight of all the people, but would rather get you to ſleepe in ſome corner, for <hi>Ionah</hi> went vnder the hatches to ſleepe, and would not ſleepe in the ſight of the mariners.

               <p>After that the ſhip-maiſter had wakened <hi>Ionah,</hi> he bids him call vpon his God, as if he had ſaid, watch and pray; he ſpeakes like a Saint, yet he is an infidell, he ſayd not, call vpon our gods, but call vpon thy God, the ſhip-maiſter would not call him his God, but (ſaith he) call vpon thy God, and it may be he will helpe vs: but if he had ſayd, call vpon our God, when he ſayd call vpon thy God, and if he had ſaid he will helpe vs, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he ſayd if ſo be he will helpe vs, then he had ſhewed ſome ſparke of faith.

               <p>The Gentiles had a cuſtome, that in the time of common plague, they ſacrificed one for the reſt, this cuſtome they tooke by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Iewes in offering beaſts, and of <hi>Abraham</hi> in offering his ſonne.

Therefore we come with ſhame and ſorow to confeſſe our ſinnes, not ſmall but grieuous, not few but infinite, not paſt but preſent, not ſecret but preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous againſt thy expreſſe word and will, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our owne conſcience, knowledge and liking if any had done them but our ſelues.
